** Introduction
   Slit-Scan is the command-line tool that allow you to create slit-scans similar to
   the star-gate sequences in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The idea here is to add a lot of flexibility
   to allow you to acheive results even beyond what was acheived in what is arguably the greatest
   Science Fiction film of all time.
** Mathematics
   Here, we fully specify the mathematics involved with the slit-scan function.

*** Generating the slit
    Firstly, we define the slit function as a function between 2 points.
     
     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
     \item $t$ is time, in seconds, and
     \item $p_1, p_2$ are points defining tbe beginning and ending of the slit, and
     \item $$
      slit(p_1, p_2, \rho) = g(p_1, p_2, curve(\rho)) \Bigr| _{\rho=0} ^{\rho=1}
     $$
     \item where $$
     \begin{array}{l}
     p_1 = (x_1, y_1)\\
     p_2 = (x_2, y_2)
     \end{array}
     $$
     \item and $0 \ge x, y, \rho \ge 1$
     #+END_EXPORT

      where $curve(\rho)$ defines the shape of the slit. For the traditional case,
      $curve(\rho)$ will be $0$, defining a straight line from $p_1$ to $p_2$. In other cases,
      $curve(\rho)$ will result in pertubations in the $(p_1, p_2)$ line, perpendular to the
      line itself.
     
      $\rho$ is the parametic for the slit. $x$ and $y$ represnts the idealized coordinates of the
      image being scanned by the slit, which will be converted to the actual physical coordinates of
      the pixels in the image, along with pixel averaging in the 3x3 or 5x5 square with the physical
      coordinate being at the center.

    Secondly, we define the movement of the slit across an image in terms of time $t$ (in seconds):

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
     $$
     \begin{array}{l}
         p_1{_t} = p_1(t)\\
         p_2{_t} = p_2(t)
     \end{array}
     $$
     #+END_EXPORT
     
      Where said movement of $p_1$ and $p_2$ may be independent with each other, solely with $t$ as their
      common parametric basis, but in most cases the "trivial" or traditional approach will be taken as the 
      movenent being equivalent, basically to "scan" the image from one side to the other.

    Thirdly, we define the compositor function. The compositor is responsible for compositing the time-varying
    contents of the slit unto the final canvas. Here, the canvas is bisected either horizontally or vertically
    by a straight-line slit, and with each time instant, the slit contents is forwarded away from the slit.

*** The Compositor
    The compositor may "stretch" the contents of the slit as a function of the distance from the slit until it
    reaches the end of the canvass.
    
     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
     \tikzset{annotations/.style = {
       tsx/show help lines,
       every path/.append style = {very thick, color = red},
       every node/.append style = {blue, font = \bfseries\sffamily}}}

     \begin{tikzonimage}[width=.8\textwidth]{images/compositor.png}
       [annotations]
       \draw (0.3,0.5) edge[->] (0.1,0.9) (0.73,0.4) edge[->] (0.9,0.9);
       \node[rotate=90] at (0.27,0.3) {canvas};
       \node[rotate=30] at (0.86,0.65) {slit expansion};
     \end{tikzonimage}
     #+END_EXPORT

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
     \begin{tikzpicture}
       \begin{axis} [grid, axis lines=center]
       \addplot [domain=-3:3, thick, smooth] { x^3 - 6*x };
       \end{axis}
     \end{tikzpicture}

     $$
      \frac{f(x)-f(a) x-a}g
     $$
     #+END_EXPORT

* General Documentation and Use of Slit Scan
  This covers the usage from the command-line. Rather than go into extensive documentation
  on the command-line commands and options (the program itself provides this), we shall
  give some helpul examples.
** Simple case -- one image, simple vertical slit
   slit-scan --i1 flower.jpg --format png --out film/

** Typical -- 2 images simple vertical and horizontal slits
** Advanced 1 -- 2 images, staight line rotating slit
** Advanced 2 -- 2 images, sine slit
** Advanced 3 -- 2 images, rotating sine slit
** Advanced 4 -- 2 images, arbitrary function for the slit and the 2 endpoints
